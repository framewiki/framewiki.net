# Framework Laptop 13

Framework Laptop 13 is [Framework](/framework-computer-inc)'s first product. Initially branded simply as Framework Laptop, the company rebranded the product as Framework Laptop 13 in 2023 to distinguish it from the newly-announced [Framework Laptop 16](/framework-laptop-16). 

The initial version featured 11th Gen Intel Core CPUs, but it has since been updated with 12th and 13th Gen Intel CPUS, as well as AMD 7040 series offerings.

## Customization
Framework Laptop 13 has four [expansion card](/expansion-cards) slots. The keyboard and bezel can also be easily swapped to add more customization.

## DIY Edition
Framework Laptop 13 is available in pre-built and DIY configurations. Though the initial intent was for consumers to assemble the entire laptop themselves, DIY edition laptops come mostly pre-assembled for legal and practical reasons. Shipping components individually would require more packing material and a physically larger package, which would increase shipping costs. It would also change the package's import designation, which would add additional tariffs and duties. [^1] Shipping lithium ion batteries that are not installed in a device adds additional restrictions as well. [^2]

The first batches of DIY edition laptops had consumers install their own RAM, SSD, Wifi and Expansion cards. After receiving feedback that the WiFi module was difficult to install, Framework began installing it at the factory. [^3]

Beginning with 13th Gen Intel Core and AMD 7040 Series, DIY edition Framework Laptop 13s ship without the input cover and bezel installed in order to add more customization options and optimize the number of SKUs required. [[citation needed]](/framewiki:citation-needed)

DIY Edition laptops are fully assembled at the factory for quality assurance testing before being partially disasembled and packaged. [^6]. For this reason, if a customer buys all the parts --- including a power adapter and Windows license --- from Framework's marketplace, DIY Edition laptops are slightly more expensive when compared to a similarly configured pre-built.

## Changes By Generation
### [11th Gen Intel Core](/framework-laptop-13/11th-gen)
In October 2021, Framework switched the audio codec from Realtek ALC295 to the Tempo 92HD95B due to chip shortages. [^4]

### [12th Gen Intel Core](/framework-laptop-13/12th-gen)
Batch 1 of 12th Gen Intel Core began shipping in July 2022. Compared to 11th Gen Intel Core, it included the following changes:

- Improved CNC alluminum top cover
- RTC battery no longer required

Linus Tech Tips incorrectly claimed that 12th Gen also shipped with new 4 kg hinges. [^5] In fact, it shipped with the same 3.3 kg hinges as 11th gen, but 4 kg hinges were added to the marketplace.

### [13th Gen Intel Core](/framework-laptop-13/13th-gen)
Batch 1 of 13th Gen Intel Core began shipping in May 2023 after it was announced at the same time as AMD 7040 series. Compared to 12th Gen Intel Core, it included the following changes:

- Matte display
- Improved 3.5 kg hinges.
- RTC battery not included by default (Though an ML1220 battery holder can be populated for standalone use)
- Louder 80 dB speakers
- WiFi card bracket to hold keep antennas connected while handling the card

Laptops configured with a Core i7 CPU also include a higher-capacity 61 watt hour battery.

### [AMD 7040 Series](/framework-laptop-13/7040-series)
Batch 1 of AMD 7040 series began mass production in September 2023 after it was announced at the same time as 13th Gen Intel Core. Compared to 12th Gen Intel Core, it included the following changes:

- Matte display (2.8k 120 Hz offered later)
- Improved 3.5 kg hinges.
- RTC battery not included by default (Though a battery with a 2-pin connector can be populated for standalone use)
- 2-pin RTC battery connector
- Return to the RealTek ALC295 Audio CODEC
- WiFi card bracket to hold keep antennas connected while handling the card

Devices configured with a Ryzen 7 CPU or a 2.8k display also include the higher-capacity 61 watt hour battery.

### [Intel Core Ultra Series 1](/framework-laptop-13/core-ultra-1)
Batch 1 of Core Ultra Series 1 began shipping in August 2024 after it was announced in May 2024. Compared to 13th Gen Intel Core, it included the following changes:

- 2.8k 120 Hz display added as an option
- 2nd gen webcam
- Switch from ML1220 battery holder to 2-pin connector for RTC battery
- Switch to RealTek ALC285 Audio CODEC
- 61 Wh battery on all models
