# Framework Laptop 13

Framework Laptop 13 is [Framework](/framework-computer-inc)'s first product. Initially branded simply as Framework Laptop, the company rebranded the product as Framework Laptop 13 in 2023 to distinguish it from the newly-announced [Framework Laptop 16](/framework-laptop-16). 

The initial version featured 11th Gen Intel Core CPUs, but it has since been updated with 12th and 13th Gen Intel CPUS, as well as AMD 7040 series offerings.

## Customization
Framework Laptop 13 has four [expansion card](/expansion-cards) slots. The keyboard and bezel can also be easily swapped to add more customization.

## DIY Edition
Framework Laptop 13 is available in pre-built and DIY configurations. Though the initial intent was for consumers to assemble the entire laptop themselves, DIY edition laptops come mostly pre-assembled for legal and practical reasons. Shipping components individually would require more packing material and a physically larger package, which would increase shipping costs. It would also change the package's import designation, which would add additional tariffs and duties.

The first batches of DIY edition laptops had consumers install their own RAM, SSD, Wifi and Expansion cards. After receiving feedback that the WiFi module was difficult to install, Framework began installing it at the factory.

Beginning with 13th Gen Intel Core and AMD 7040 Series, DIY edition Framework Laptop 13s ship without the input cover and bezel installed in order to add more customization options and optimize the number of SKUs required. [[citation needed]](/framewiki:citation-needed)

DIY Edition laptops are fully assembled at the factory for quality assurance testing before being partially disasembled and packaged. [[6]](https://youtu.be/7nXVJBGowmY?si=MZ5TnfNff_bH2Nl7&t=634). For this reason, if a customer buys all the parts --- including a power adapter and Windows license --- from Framework's marketplace, DIY Edition laptops are slightly more expensive when compared to a similarly configured pre-built.
