## Reviews
Framework sent press review units comprising "a mix of pre-built or DIY Edition systems as well as bundles of the new modules. These upgrade kits contained every module required to go from a 12th Gen Framework Laptop 13 to the latest and greatest configuration." [^34] Reviewers included Andrew Cunningham from Ars Technica [^35], Monica Chin from The Verge [^36] and Allen Ngo from Notebookcheck [^37]

## Known Issues
### Fingerprint Sensor Firmware
On some 13th Gen Intel Framework Laptop 13s, `libfprint` does not recognize the fingerprint sensor on Linux due to a Goodix firmware incompatibility. [^32] A beta fingerprint sensor firmware update is available via LVFS to resolve the issue. [^33]
