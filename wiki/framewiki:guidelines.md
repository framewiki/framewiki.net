# Framewiki: Guidelines

## Citations
To ensure all content on Framewiki is verifiable, claims should be backed up with citations to a trusted source whenever possible. Community speculation should never be cited as a source, and such citations should be replaced with a [[citation needed]](/framewiki:citation-needed) tag.

To add a citation, insert the following Markdown syntax. It should be inserted after the period at the end of thr sentence it applies to. The number inside the brackets should be the order in which the source was added; it is normal for this to be different from the order it appears on the page. 

```md
[[1]](https://frame.work)
