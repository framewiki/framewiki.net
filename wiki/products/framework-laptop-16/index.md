The current generation is available with AMD Ryzen AI 300 series CPUs. Both [AMD Radeon RX7700S GPU](/expansion-bay/radeon-rx-7700s) and [NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 GPU](/expansion-bay/geforce-rtx-5070) are available to connect to the [expansion bay](/expansion-bay).

## Customization
Framework Laptop 16's flagship features are the [expansion bay](/expansion-bay) and [input module](/input-modules) systems. Input modules allow users to rearrange the laptop's input deck, allowing them to add a combination of a keyboard, trackpad, number pads, macro pads, and decorative covers in various positions on the laptop's C Cover. The Expansion bay allows users to install functional modules, such as a graphics card or additional M.2 slots, using a custom slot at the back of the laptop.

Framework Laptop 16 also has six [expansion card](/expansion-cards) slots. Like [Framework Laptop 13](/framework-laptop-13), Framework offers multiple bezel color options for visual customization.
