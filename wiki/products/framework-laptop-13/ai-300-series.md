# Framework Laptop 13 (AMD Ryzen AI 300 Series)
{% include sidecar.html %}
**Framework Laptop 13 (Ryzen AI 300)** was announced on February 25, 2025 during the [Framework [2nd Gen] event](/events/2nd-gen).[^1] Preorders opened the same day, immediately following the live event. The first batch of laptops are expected to begin shipping in April 2025.[^2]

Ryzen AI 300 Series is the first to use Framework's second generation keyboard, which has reduced resonance to prevent rattling when using the built-in speakers at the maximum volume. Pre-built laptops come with the Microsoft Copilot key on the start button, but DIY edition is available with either the Microsoft Copilot key or the Framework logo.[^2]

The laptop is Framework's first to support Wi-Fi 7 using the AMD RZ717 Wi-Fi card.[^3] It also is the first Framework Laptop 13 to use a redesigned cooler, which uses one large 10mm heatpipe and Honeywell PTM7958 phase-change thermal interface material.[^2]
